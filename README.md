# Hotel-Bookings-Data-Analysis
The goal of this project was to analyze the hotel_bookings.csv dataset, which contains information on hotel bookings. The analysis aimed to uncover insights into booking patterns, cancelations, and other key metrics, and to build a predictive model to determine whether a booking would be canceled.
