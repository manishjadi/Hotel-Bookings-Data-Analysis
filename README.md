# Hotel-Bookings-Data-Analysis
**Objective:**
The goal of this project was to analyze the hotel_bookings.csv dataset, which contains information on hotel bookings. The analysis aimed to uncover insights into booking patterns, cancelations, and other key metrics, and to build a predictive model to determine whether a booking would be canceled.

**Project Insight:**
The project involved analyzing a dataset of 119,390 hotel bookings with 32 features, focusing on booking cancelations, lead times, and guest details. Missing values were addressed, and exploratory analysis revealed a high cancelation rate, a right-skewed distribution of the Average Daily Rate (ADR), and more bookings in City Hotels than in Resort Hotels. A positive correlation was found between lead time and cancelations. Predictive modeling was attempted to forecast cancelations using selected features, with the data split and standardized for model training.

**Challenges:**
While attempting to build the predictive model, technical limitations prevented the completion of the modeling phase.

**Conclusion:**
This project provided valuable insights into hotel booking patterns, particularly around cancelations. The findings from this project can help hotel managers understand booking behaviors better and potentially reduce cancelation rates through targeted strategies.
